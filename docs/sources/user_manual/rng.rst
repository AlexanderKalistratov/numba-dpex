Random number generation
========================

**Data Parallel Extension for Numba** provides a variety of *pseudo-random number generators* to sample from
different statistical distributions. These generators rely on `Data Parallel Extension for Numpy*`_ ``dpnp.random``
capabilities, and can be used within ``@njit`` function.

Please refer to `Data Parallel Extension for Numpy*`_ documentation for further details.
